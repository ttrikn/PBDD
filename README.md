### Data preprocessing
As mentioned in our paper, in order to train our model, you can download the Original Twitter dataset here: [[Twitter]](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1RI3l8fomIXHuR8e0_hUyhA?pwd=aea6). You can preprocess the dataset by the codes in the folder `datasets_pre_processing` following the steps in our paper, or you can get the proprecessed data from :[[Dataset]](https://pan.baidu.com/s/1eqYyXg6Y0PQkh-AHnpUD1g?pwd=b2lx) directly. You can also use other multimodal sentiment datasets by adjusting to the same structure as folder `dataset`.
